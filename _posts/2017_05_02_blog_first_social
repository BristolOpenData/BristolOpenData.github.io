Thanks to everyone that came along to our first Bristol Open
Data Social last week. 

It was a great turnout, and we (us Bristol Open Data Group
organisers) were really happy to see some new faces as well as some welcome
familiar ones!

I personally either had – or overheard snippets from - a
broad and stimulating range of conversations. From the positives and negatives of
Uber and companies like it, to the challenges of working with Open Land
Registry data as a relative newbie, to mapping 2nd World War landing
sites in France on Open Street Map, to city resilience and what we’d like our
city to be like in 2050.

For me that is one of the real benefits of the ‘social’
meetup – conversations can be led by personal interest and the fluid setup [insert your own 'fluid' beer-related pun here!]
means that informal connections can be made, or introductions can be made to
people that may have expertise or knowledge than could help. 

We did also come armed with sharpies and giant post its (of
course) and encouraged people to note down suggested activities, events or
otherwise for the group. The suggestions from this meetup seemed to all be
related to opportunities to gain, improve or develop practical data skills. 

We’re now planning our next meetup on Wednesday June 28th
– go to our Meetup page to RSVP. We welcome anyone and everyone interested in
open data regardless of knowledge level and tech-savvy-ness. https://www.meetup.com/Bristol_Open_Data/

As ever we are really greatful to Epimorphics for their
generous sponsorship which enables us to use Meetup.com, and to High Tech
Bristol and Bath CIC for hosting and supporting the Bristol Open Data Group and
our ODI Node status.
