![The first Bristol Open Data social gathering]({{site.url}}/assets/images/bodsoc1.jpg)

Our [next meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bristol_Open_Data/events/239534942/) is another informal gathering to meet up with 
the Bristol Open Data Group – we have some great plans for future meetups, but
we’re also keen to hear from you about any ideas or suggestions you have. 
Another thing we are keen for is more volunteers to our group (we are
a not for profit, volunteer run, community group), so if you think you might like to get involved,
come along to meet us. 

Into Open Data? Great – come along! Heard of Open Data but
no real idea what it means? Great – come along! Somewhere in between? Great –
come along! 

This is an open data group that is as much for people who
don’t know what open data is as it is for people who are into open data. Come
meet us, we’re nice!
