[ODI Leeds](https://odileeds.org/) have been working closely with [Defra](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs), the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs. As part of their work, we held a meeting on innovating with Defra's data, run simultaniously with ODI Leeds and ODI HQ in London. 

We looked at some of the issues and opportunities around using Defra Data. All three meetings collaborated on a single google document which has helped to shape ODI Leeds' continuing work with Defra. You can find out more about the collaboration between Defra and ODI Leeds [here](http://odileeds.org/airhack/).

We looked at the government’s data portal, [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) and talked about some of its limitations as well as the data it hosts. The Bristol meeting was a great chance for people interested in Defra’s data to meet and learn more about the data available.
