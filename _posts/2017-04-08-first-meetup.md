Our first meetup will be an informal session to introduce
the Bristol Open Data Group – we have some great plans for future meetups, but
we’re also keen to hear from you about any ideas or suggestions you have for future
meetups. Another thing we are keen for is more volunteers to our group (we are
a not for profit community group), so if you think you might like to get involved,
come along to meet us. 

Into Open Data? Great – come along! Heard of Open Data but
no real idea what it means? Great – come along! Somewhere in between? Great –
come along! 

This is an open data group that is as much for people who
don’t know what open data is as it is for people who are into open data. Come
meet us, we’re nice!
