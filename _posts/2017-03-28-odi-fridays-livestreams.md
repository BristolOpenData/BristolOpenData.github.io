Each week ODI Headquarters in London hold a [Friday lunchtime lecture](http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures) on a subject relevant to open data. The talk is live streamed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenDataInstituteUK).

<!-- more -->

Past talks have included ethical open data, art and open data, plus demos of products and tools for working with data.

We gather to watch the live stream together and discuss the talk afterwards. It’s a great opportunity to meet other data-interested people and share our thoughts and issues.

You can find details of our ODI Fridays screenings on the [ODI Bristol Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/odi-bristol-11444234774) page. Events normally go live once ODI Headquarters have published the topic for the talk.

We’re grateful to the Environment Agency for the loan of meeting rooms for our screenings. Some weeks we may be unable to run screenings when meeting rooms aren’t available.

You can keep up with the latest information about our screenings or check details with us by following ODI Bristol on Twitter [@ODIBristol](https://twitter.com/ODIBristol)
