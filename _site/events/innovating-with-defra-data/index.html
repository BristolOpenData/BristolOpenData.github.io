<p><a href="https://odileeds.org/">ODI Leeds</a> have been working closely with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs">Defra</a>, the Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs. As part of their work, we held a meeting on innovating with Defra’s data, run simultaniously with ODI Leeds and ODI London.</p>

<p>We to looked at some of the issues and opportunities around using Defra Data. All three meetings collaborated on a single google document which has helped to shape ODI Leeds’ continuing work with Defra.

<p>We looked at the government’s data portal, <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> and talked about some of its limitations as well as the data it host. The Bristol meeting was a great chance for people interested in Defra’s data to meet and learn more about the data available.</p>
