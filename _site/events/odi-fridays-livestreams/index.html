<p>Each week ODI Headquarters in London hold a <a href="http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures">Friday lunchtime lecture</a> on a subject relevant to open data. The talk is live streamed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenDataInstituteUK">YouTube</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Past talks have included ethical open data, art and open data, plus demos of products and tools for working with data.</p>

<p>We gather to watch the live stream together and discuss the talk afterwards. It’s a great opportunity to meet other data-interested people and share our thoughts and issues.</p>

<p>We’re grateful to the Environment Agency for the loan of meeting rooms for our screenings. Some weeks we may be unable to run screenings when meeting rooms aren’t available.</p>
